## Gameplay and Mechanics

**Don't Starve Together** is a survival game that blends exploration, crafting, and combat. The core gameplay revolves around gathering resources, crafting tools and shelter, and managing hunger, health, and sanity. Players need to find food, stay warm during the night, and fight off hostile creatures that lurk in the world. The survival experience is often made more challenging by seasons, each of which introduces new hazards.

The game features a variety of playable characters, each with unique abilities and drawbacks.
